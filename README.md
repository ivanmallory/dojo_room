# Dojo Room

Collaborated with a couple fellow classmates to construct a full stack social media platform inspired by Twitter

-Managed the complete front end of the project to create a user-friendly experience with easily accessible pages. 

-Applied Bootstrap framework for styling to keep code organized and consistent across the application, thus enhancing the userâ€™s browsing experience.

-Incorporated Flask and Jinja to connect the front end to the back end and retrieve any information that the user uploaded into the database. 

-Applied Bcrypt functionality to increase security by including validation checks for users registering and logging into the application.
