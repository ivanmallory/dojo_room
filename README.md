# dojo_room

Along with two classmates, I constructed a mock “Twitter” platform from the ground up using HTML, CSS, Boostrap, Python, Jinja, and MySQL.  Was responsible for adding HTML content, styling the platform, and building several backend functions. Integrated Bootstrap CSS to create a simple, yet modern looking interface.  Incorporated Flask and Jinja in order to connect to SQL database, retrieve information, and display it on the platform.  Applied Flask and Jinja to build several backend functions including a function with validation checks for posting messages and a function allowing a user to upload information which would then be stored in the SQL database.
